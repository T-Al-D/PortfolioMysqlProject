-- syntax for writing simple querys. Not all keywords need to be used, but it is important to KEEP THE ORDER !

-- CREATE VIEW AS ....			-> view (with a name) is created instead of query 
-- SELET .... AS .... 			-> select is a column (projection) , as is an alias (for another name)
-- FROM  ....					-> From which relation(table)?
-- 	 WHERE  .... LIKE %...%     -> where is for conditional selection, use like%_% if searched for certain letteres
--   OR...BETWEEN...AND  ...	-> used between the "where" if multiple conditions are needed / or possible
-- 	 GROUP BY  ....				-> same attributes are listed (only) once
-- 	 HAVING ...					-> use this if alias is present or with aggregationfunction (SUM, MAX, ...)
-- 	 ORDER BY  ....ASC/DESC		-> sorting the query through factors (primary, secondary,...) ascending or descending
-- 	 LIMIT	....				-> maximum tablelength

-- syntax for complex querys with JOIN 

-- select A.column, B.column, .... from tableA A ______ join tableB B on A.column = B.column ;  
--                       -> fill in the blank for inner, left/right outer join or natural join
-- inner join			 ->  fusing of same columns, column without fitting partner exculded
-- natural join 		 ->  if 2 columns are the same di inner join else cross join
-- outer join			 ->  outer join where one (or both if full) table is displayed (completely) and fused with the other table if possible
